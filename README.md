# This project in the  To-do List app but based upon the files.

# project functionalities.
1.Show_tasks()
2.Add_task()
3.Mark_task()
4.Delete_task()
5.Save_tasks()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the abve four are the main functionalities for this project
In this project we work on the OS module because whenever we work with files we have to work with OS module.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.Show_tasks():
---------------
Here we show the tasks list to user every time when he chooses the option for show tasks this function we call in mark_tasks() and delete_tasks()
in the case user have to know how many tasks are there in the file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.save_tasks()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This function is main function beacuse everytime we add the task or delete the task or mark the task we work on list but aftetr that we have to save the task that is done by this function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3.Mark_task()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this task we done some different manner.
for every task we will keep the square bracket and suppose if we want to mark the task then we can change that one.
[]------>[X]
so before the task if the symbol is changed then the task is marked.
Here also we show the tasks() before keep updating.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4.Add_task()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this function is called by if the user click the corresponding number then it call this function.
In side the function user have to give task name so we add that task to list of tasks.
after that adding list of tasks we will call the save_tasks() function it will save tasks into file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5.Delete_task()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we delete the task based on the number.
in our function all tasks in the list of tasks so we know the index number then we pop the element.
fter pop the pop element we have to call the save_tasks() function.

In this project eveything is handled by exception handlers and edge cases because everyone give some different numbers so it will chage.
